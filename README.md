# Star Wars App

This app provides details about Star Wars characters, including their Name, Height, and Birth Year, and dynamically renders them in a tabular format.

# Key Features:

Search Functionality: The app includes a search bar that allows users to search for characters from the Star Wars API dynamically as they type. There’s no need for a search button—results appear instantly.

Character Listing: Displays a list of characters in a table format with the following details:
Name
Height
Birth Year


# Responsive Design:

 The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes.

# Issues Faced:

I encountered no significant challenges during development since the API worked perfectly when tested on Postman. This made the process smooth and efficient.

# Tailwind CSS

I make use of tailwind css instead of conventional css.
 
This assessment was a great experience, and I look forward to moving on to the next stage of the recruitment process.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Best regards,
